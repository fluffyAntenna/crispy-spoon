DEFINE THE TILESET

TESTING FLOOR CREATION
floor.create(30, 15)
floor.printFloor()

DRAWING PLAYER
#drawFrom = (center[0] - player.spot[1], center[1] - player.spot[0]) #The Player should be the middle of the window
#drawSpot = (drawFrom[0] + self.spot[1], drawFrom[1] + self.spot[0])
#screen.blit(basicPlayer, (drawSpot[0] * 64, drawSpot[1] * 64))

TESTING INVINCIRAT'S ATTACK
while invincirat.health > 0:
    player.attack(invincirat)
    print "P:", player.health
    invincirat.attack(player)
    print "I:", invincirat.health
