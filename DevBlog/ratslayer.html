    <h2 class="posttext">DONE</h2>
    <p class="posttext">Today I implemented a health tick. The player now regenerates 1 health point every seven steps if they don't already have their max health. I also added attack methods for the player and each enemy currently in the code (Slimes and Rats). I added some textures to reduce the general ugliness of the way I was drawing the game. I borrowed the textures from a Minecraft texture pack called Ovo's Rustic Redemption. I would recommend checking it out. I do plan to replace the textures before I finish. Lastly for today, I created a placeholder icon for the game.</p>
    <h2 class="posttext">TODO</h2>
    <p class="posttext">The plan for tomorrow is to work on the way the map is drawn. I want the player to be centered on the screen and the map to move in relation to the player, which would make it so the player can see the spaces around them, as opposed to the player walking off the screen which currently happens. I also plan to create rooms on the floor so that the game is not just a maze the player has to navigate. Combat would become a pain if the player could only fight in a one space wide corridor. I also would like to make enemies die and drop loot. On the topic of combat, there is a way for the player to attack and for enemies to attack but no way for it to happen in game. I need to work on enemy collision detection, as well as adding more enemies. Finally, I'm going to create the first boss enemy: Invincirat.</p>

    <h2 class="posttext">DONE</h2>
    <p class="posttext">Today I laid down the basics for the game. I created classes for the Floor, the Player, and a default Enemy class. I set up a dungeon templating function. I created a placeholder splashscreen for fluffyAntenna and the game displays it before handing control to the player. Lastly, I added basic player movement.</p>
    <h2 class="posttext">TODO</h2>
    <p class="posttext">The plan for tomorrow is to create an attack damage scheme, plan out levels of armor and weapons, draw the map, generate rooms, and make enemies die and drop things.</p>
